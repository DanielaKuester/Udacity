### Lesson 2: Generating Your Own Bitmaps

*Generating Your Own Bitmaps*

We just discussed the need to have several versions of a single image at different dpis - in order to have an image appear the same size we’ll need a number of different copies of the image at different resolutions (pixel count).

So in the projects you've worked on, we’ve provided you the images you've needed at the various dpis, but you may be wondering how you'll get images in different densities for your own projects.

Thankfully, there are a number of tools available to help you find free images as well as generate images at different resolutions (if you have a friend who’s a UI designer, they can also be a helpful resource for getting images for your app :P)

Here's a compiled list with contributions from our helpful forum mentors (speical shoutout to @sudhirkhanger and @Alex_234).

> Lastly, Convert Images to the Appropriate Resolution Sizes
- [Android Drawable Converter Tool](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7658-android-drawable-importer) (Important Note: A common thing students miss when using Android Drawable Converter Tool is setting the base resolution. When you have a drawable ready to give to the importer, you'll need to set it to the "source resolution".)
